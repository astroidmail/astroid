Hi,
refering to

https://packages.debian.org/search?lang=en&suite=all&searchon=names&keywords=geany-plugin-gdb

I added the line
deb http://ftp.jp.debian.org/debian/ wheezy main
to /etc/apt/sources.list, and apt-get updated,
but I was not able to install geany-plugin-gdb.

$ sudo apt-get install geany-plugin-gdb

What should I do?
And why isn't geany-plugin-gdb in the jessie repository?

And you should not be able to as most of geany plugins depend on exact
version of geany.

This:

> geany-plugin-gdb : Depends: geany-plugins-common (= 0.21.1.dfsg-4) but
> 1.24+dfsg-5 is to be installed

clearly shows us that you have installed geany from jessie, so the only
kind of plugins that fit your install are geany plugins from Jessie.

Try installing 'geany-plugin-debugger' instead.


> And why isn't geany-plugin-gdb in the jessie repository?

My guess is that they simply renamed the package.

I will, after having investigated a bit more :-)

I was worried to notice the bug is still there when booting as 
multi-user, that is with no X, and this was confirmed this morning, 
there are no X recent logs.

so I looked at the kernel logs and noticed a crash:

http://dodin.org/owncloud/index.php/s/PzRjuxtZHKbMwzK

that seems to be a known issue, with some fixes, but I do not really 
understand what I have to do to apply the fixes :-(

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1492632

https://bugs.launchpad.net/mesa/+bug/1274315

any way to do this on the grub kernel command line?

You can certainly do it but I am not sure you want!

First of all you would have to move your /home to a new partition (to
the same disk or another) and you would need to start from a Live CD/USB
in order to do this step. Of course if you don't have another HD
available then you would have to partition the disk which is risky for
your data which you would have to backup elsewhere etc

Next is the new installation procedure where you will eventually connect
the new system with the old /home.

However let me note that some of the problems of your current
installation may live inside /home which means that you will still have
to deal with them. The /home folder contains not only your data but also
various settings files for your applications.

So, as I said, you can certainly do it but I am not sure you want!

Another approach would be to start a new thread (or more!) on this
helpful list in order to try to solve your system's problems. Of course
you can always re-install and start from scratch but how can you be sure
you will not end on the same position after a while.

I looked on the web, and no suggestion helped. Except one: one of then =
said his worked when he ran bind (aka named) as root. I tried that and =
sure enough, it 'fixed' the problem. Until monit somehow noticed the DNS =
wasn't running and started it from /etc/init.d (I'm still running =
Wheezy).=20

It happens only on the master DNS server -- the slaves do their dumps =
successfully, or maybe they don't try.

I tried su -'ing from root to user bind (after giving bind a shell). No =
joy.

Everything in /var/cache/bind is owned by bind:bind, it's all owner and =
group writable, root manages to write the files, there are no complaints =
about the masters directory (there are also no files called tmp-*** in =
there), and I'm at a loss as to why there's a problem setting the =
modification time (touch does it just fine).

Has anyone seen this and fixed it?=20

I'm guessing somebody's just kidding about the directory they're trying =
to write into, and their real directory is owned by user nobody...

Just to make sure, your filesystem is OK, right?

Just do a normal install with manual filesystem configuration, choose the=
 existing partition with the prior filesystem format and make sure to _no=
t_ choose format partition. The installer will warn you, something along =
the lines that it will overwrite the old /usr, /etc/, /var, etc - which i=
s what you want.

optionally you can remove all directories but /home (and may be /root pri=
or to installation from a live system (the installer will do).

I strongly advise to make the backup before nonetheless - breaking things=
 is easy, especially in the installer. This procedure will however spare =
you restoring thing from the backup, if it works.

Or move /home from a terminal as root.  But if you have to create a new 
partition you might as well move /home while you are using the live CD.

This was my impression too: installation should not wipe home (actually
it should'nt wipe anything, e.g. /usr/local and friends, just overwrite
existing packages with their newer versions.

That said, and as arian states, it's easy to fat-finger something and
format your disks, so a backup is in order; and you might meet some
niggles, like new packages stumbling upon older configurations and
data in your home (think ~/.config, but also ~/.openffice.org, ~/.gimp
and whatever nice things apps put into your home). Some may cope
and some not.

Hi all.

My name is Mark, and I try since a few days to implement outbound traffic shaping with cgoups and its podsystems (especially - "net_cls", "net_prio") and iptables. The problem is to enable cgroups (subsystems "net_cls" and daemons like "cgrulesengd") Spent many hours looking for education stuff, but everything was time wasting only. In my opinion something must be wrong with Kernel ( set-up?, patching?, upgrade? )
 My Kernel - 3.16.If you could explain how-to in a few words, it would be really great news for me. We all belongs to big "Debian Family" are we not?

Regards from Dublin
Mark

A case study:

1) Ensure that you're *not* running systemd as PID=1. It *will* screw
things up, do not try it.

2) Ensure that you don't have any services in enabled state that try to
configure cgroups on their own. libvirtd or cgmanager, for instance.

3) Write a configuration file /etc/cgconfig.conf with the contents like
this:

mount {
    cpuset = /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset;
    cpu = /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu;
    cpuacct = /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuacct;
    devices = /sys/fs/cgroup/devices;
    freezer = /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer;
    net_cls = /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls;
    blkio = /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio;
    perf_event = /sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event;
}

group mynet {
    net_cls {
        net_cls.classid="122541";
    }
}

4) Invoke:

mount -t tmpfs cgroup_root /sys/fs/cgroup
/usr/sbin/cgconfigparser -l /etc/cgconfig.conf

5) If all goes well you should see a bunch of mounted filesystems of
type cgroup, one for each controller.

6) Create a configuration file /etc/cgrules.conf with the contents
like this:

*:/bin/bash net_cls mynet

7) Start cgrulesengd for debugging:

/usr/sbin/cgrulesengd -nv

8) Observe all instances of bash to migrate to mynet cgroup.
Double-check it with:

cat /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls/nonet/tasks

9) Clean up:

/usr/sbin/cgclear
umount /sys/fs/cgroup
