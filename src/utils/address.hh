  /* Encoding and quoting:
   *
   * On construction of Address and AddressLists the full email address (mbox)
   * gets interpreted (decoded and unquoted) by gmime. It is saved in UTF-8 in
   * an ustring.
   *
   * When returnd from Address::full_address() or AddressList::str() it is not
   * re-encoded, but it remains quoted. It is therefore suitable for an UTF-8
   * editor which saves the draft email with the email addresses in quoted,
   * unencoded, format.
   *
   * ComposeMessage loads the draft email (without decoding the address) and
   * before displaying, sending or saving it build()'s and finalize()'s the message
   * encoding the quoted address.
