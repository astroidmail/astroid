  works.

  normalized to within a configurable range. The same tag will therefore
  always have the same color.

* Thread-index: load all threads in the background.

* All actions requiring write-access run in the background and wait for
  any reads to finish. All read operations need to wait for any ongoing
  write-operations to finish. All write-operations are therefore
  asynchronous and non-blocking. Read-operations will only block on long
  write operations.

  Glib::DateTime::format().
