== v0.13 / 2018-07-20

* Move to WebKit2

  We have now finally moved to WebKit2. This is a big change since the previous
  functionality had to be moved to a WebExtension running in a separate process.

  The IPC with the extension is implemented using Google ProtoBufs (>= 3.0)
  and Unix Domain Sockets.

  WebKit2 is actively maintained and consequently a long list of CVEs in the
  old WebKit no longer cause worries. Additionally, each part is shown in
  separate IFRAMEs so that essentially all received content is sandboxed (some
  metadata like addresses are escaped and shown in main page). This protects better
  against EFAIL type attacks (which I believe we were not vulnerable to anyway).

  Expect some instability while breaking in this new change!

  Important:  Make sure you update your plugins! If they try to use the old
              WebKit GIO bindings with the new WebKit objects astroid will freeze.

Part rendering:
* Show parts in IFRAME
* Toggle between parts without re-opening
* The default part shown (HTML or TEXT) is now configurable
* Optionally show HTML part if no other part

Images and EFAIL:
* Do not allow images in encrypted messages (#499)
* Show CID (attached) images in HTML parts (on C-i)
* Zoom messages with C-+ and C--

Syntax highlighting:
* Syntax highlighting through JS has been replaced by a syntax highlight
  plugin based on Pygments.

* Add filter_part plugin method, which can be used to modify the displayed HTML
  depending on either the text/plain or the text/html part.

Misc:
* Logging can be configured to go to syslog (or stdout, default). File logging
  is removed since we now have multiple processes and this would complicate
  writing to one file.

* The configuration file is no longer written back by default if missing values
  are found. This also means that values undefined by the user will be updated
  if the default is changed.

  Various checks for merging older versions of the configuration file to the
  current version has been removed. The parser is more resilient and the old
  versions are old.
