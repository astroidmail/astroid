# getting started

> Astroid is a Mail User Agent. As such, all Astroid provides is a graphical interface to your email. Thus, Astroid enables you to launch actions that rely on the performance of other programs to actually fetch, sync, index, search and send your email. A [suggested setup](https://github.com/gauteh/astroid/wiki/Astroid-in-your-general-mail-setup) is described in the wiki.

Check out the [tour of how to install, configure and use astroid](https://github.com/gauteh/astroid/wiki). Brief instructions are provided [below](#acquiring-astroid).

## main features and goals include:
* lightweight and fast!
* fully operatable by [keyboard](https://github.com/gauteh/astroid/wiki/Customizing-key-bindings).
* graphical interface, inspired by sup. but allow buffers to be separeted and placed in several windows.
* allow several simultaneous windows.
* display html mail and some attachments inline.
* render math using MathJax
* syntax highlighting between triple-backtick tags (markdown style)
* [themable and configurable](https://github.com/gauteh/astroid/wiki/Customizing-the-user-interface)
* built-in crypto (gpg,..) support (in progress).
* editors: [embed vim or emacs](https://github.com/gauteh/astroid/wiki/Customizing-editor) (or anything else that supports XEmbed)
* and more...
