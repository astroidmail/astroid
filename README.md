## acquiring astroid

get astroid by doing:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/astroidmail/astroid.git
```

## installation and usage

### compiling

```sh
$ cd astroid
$ cmake -H. -Bbuild -GNinja # to use the ninja backend
$ cmake --build build
```

run `cmake -DOPTION=VALUE ..` from `build/` to set any build options (list with `cmake -L`). Subsequent builds can be done by running `ninja` (or `make` if you are using that) from the build directory.

to run the tests do:

```sh
$ cd build
$ ctest
```

### installing

Configure with a prefix and install:
```sh
$ cmake -H. -Bbuild -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
$ cmake --build build --target install
```

this will install the `astroid` binary into `/usr/local/bin/`, and data files into `/usr/local/share/astroid/`. Refer to the [installing section](https://github.com/astroidmail/astroid/wiki/Compiling-and-Installing) in the wiki for more information.

### configuration

The initial run of `astroid` will create a new configuration file in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/astroid` (normally: `~/.config/astroid/`). Refer to the [configuration section](https://github.com/astroidmail/astroid/wiki/Astroid-setup) in the wiki for more information.

### execution and usage

```sh
$ ./build/astroid # to run from source repository
```

press `?` to get a list of available key bindings in the current mode, navigate up and down using `j` and `k`. refer to the [usage section](https://github.com/astroidmail/astroid/wiki#usage) in the wiki for more information on usage and customization.
