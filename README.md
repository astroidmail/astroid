> _Astroid_ is a lightweight and fast **Mail User Agent** that provides a graphical interface to searching, displaying and composing email, organized in threads and tags. _Astroid_ uses the [notmuch](http://notmuchmail.org/) backend for blazingly fast searches through tons of email. _Astroid_ searches, displays and composes emails - and rely on other programs for fetching, syncing and sending email.

## Acquiring astroid

Get astroid through git by:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/astroidmail/astroid.git
```

## Installation and Usage

### Building

```sh
$ cd astroid
$ cmake -H. -Bbuild -GNinja # to use the ninja backend
$ cmake --build build
```

Run `cmake -DOPTION=VALUE ..` from `build/` to set any build options (list with `cmake -L`). Subsequent builds can be done by running `ninja` (or `make` if you are using that) from the build directory.

And to run the tests do:

```sh
$ cd build
$ ctest
```

#### Manual page

We use [scdoc](https://drewdevault.com/2018/05/13/scdoc.html) to generate
`astroid(1)`:  `scdoc < doc/astroid.1.scd > doc/astroid.1`.

### Installing

Configure with a prefix and install:
```sh
$ cmake -H. -Bbuild -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
$ cmake --build build --target install
```

This will install the `astroid` binary into `/usr/local/bin/`, and data files into `/usr/local/share/astroid/`. Refer to the [installing section](https://github.com/astroidmail/astroid/wiki/Compiling-and-Installing) in the wiki for more information.

### Configuration

The configuration of `astroid` is kept in the directory `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/astroid` (normally: `~/.config/astroid/`). Refer to the [configuration section](https://github.com/astroidmail/astroid/wiki/Astroid-setup) in the wiki for how to configure astroid. You can use `astroid --new-config` to create a configuration file filled with the default values. If no file exists, the [default values](https://github.com/astroidmail/astroid/blob/master/src/config.cc#L116) are used.

### Execution and Usage

```sh
$ ./build/astroid # to run from source repository
```

Press `?` to get a list of available key bindings in the current mode, navigate up and down using `j` and `k`. Refer to the [usage section](https://github.com/astroidmail/astroid/wiki#usage) in the wiki for more information on usage and customization.

  using [notmuch] as a backend.

  Some parts of the user interface and layout has been
  inspired by the [Geary] mail client. Also, some inspiration and code stems from ner (another notmuch email client).
